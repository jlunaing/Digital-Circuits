# Digital Circuits
Basics of digital design using HDL and FPGA boards. These projects were 
developed using System Verilog language and a Basys3 board from Digilent. Code 
is compatible with other FPGA boards that have switches, LEDs, pushbuttons,
7-segment displays, and Pmod interfaces.

This is a list of the projects that were developed:

1. [Half-Adder and Full-Adder Circuits](Project_01)
2. [Reduced Full-Adder Form and Unknown Function Identification](Project_01)
3. [4-bit Ripple Carry Adder and 4-bit Comparator](Project_01)
4. [Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 7-Segment Display Decoder](Project_01)
5. [BCD Comparator Display Module](Project_01)
6. [Data Latching Circuit and T Flip-Flop 4-bit Counter](Project_01)
7. [3-bit FSM-Based Counter and Sequence Detector](Project_01)
8. [FPGA-powered Robotic Arm](Project_01)
